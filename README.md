cat_v1 is my cat file

0. Imports

1. Parameters, Initial conditions

2. Solving Equations

3. Extracting Values

4. Plots

I have no idea why I have the readme file and the catv1 file, and then I have them both again in another folder. BUT I am not going to mess with this because I don't want to delete anything!
